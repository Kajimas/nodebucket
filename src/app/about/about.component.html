    <p class="lead">
      Welcome to NodeBucket, the most cunning task organizer this side of the
      Forbidden Forest. Rooted in the rich legacy of Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry, we draw our essence from the house of Slytherin â€”
      cunning, ambitious, resourceful. We're not just about organizing your
      daily spells and potion recipes; we're about doing it in a manner that
      would make Salazar Slytherin proud.

      <p class="lead">
        NodeBucket is no ordinary task manager. This is where you can organize
        your schemes, master plans, and even your Quidditch practice schedule.
        Create, view, and edit tasks with a flick of your wand, or just a drag
        and drop for the Muggles among us.
